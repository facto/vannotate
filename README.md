# Vannotate

Annotate plugs in your .vimrc (or other specified file) with their GitHub descriptions.

## Why?

Because I'm always forgetting what my plugins do, and I'm too lazy to manually copy and paste descriptions into my plugs file.

## Requirements

* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* Plug definitions where the repo name is in single quotes, exactly like this: `Plug 'tpope/some-awesome-plugin'`

## TODO:

- [ ] Support double quotes
- [ ] Support different plugin name types
- [ ] Support different plugin systems
